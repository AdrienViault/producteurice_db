# Media Folder Structure

This document describes the expected structure and naming conventions for the media files in the project.

**Key Points:**

-   The **media** folder must contain subdirectories for each entity type: **animal, crop, farm, farmer, icons,** and **product**.
-   Each entity folder (except for icons) contains numbered subdirectories (e.g., `animal_1`, `crop_1`, etc.) with additional subfolders (such as `photo`, `documentary`, and `herovideo`) holding the corresponding media files.
-   The **icons** folder contains vector graphics (SVG files) for various UI elements.

This clear structure ensures consistency when uploading or accessing media across the project.
